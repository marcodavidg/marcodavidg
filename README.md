# Hey there fellow coder ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer with a recently completed Master's Degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (åœ‹ç«‹é™½æ˜Žè¼ƒå¤§å¤§å­¸). My thesis provided me with extensive research experience in Object Detection networks. I specialize in Python, AI, and web development. I currently live in Guatemala but want to relocate to Europe. I am open to new development challenges and encourage you to check out my projects.

## Interesting facts about me
- I have a passion for learning languages. Spanish is my native tongue, and I am fluent in English. I studied Chinese intensively for a full year here in Taiwan, and although my French is now a bit rusty after seven years of study, I'm eager to pick it back up. I'm also looking forward to learning German next.
- I've been working as an English teacher for young children as a part-time job. This experience has significantly increased my patience levels.
