# Hey there fellow coder ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marco, a software engineer and AI researcher with a Masterâ€™s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (åœ‹ç«‹é™½æ˜Žäº¤é€šå¤§å­¸). My research spans object detection, neural network compression, and image generation, and I have hands-on experience working with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and cutting-edge models like GANs and DETR.

I specialize in Python, AI, and full-stack web development, with experience in projects for industry leaders like Garmin and Foxconn. Currently based in Guatemala, Iâ€™m open to new challenges worldwide, especially in Europe. Feel free to explore my projects, and letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking to collaborate or discuss tech ideas!

## Interesting facts about me
- I have a passion for learning languages. Spanish is my native tongue, and I am fluent in English. I studied Chinese intensively for a full year here in Taiwan, and although my French is now a bit rusty after seven years of study, I'm eager to pick it back up. I'm also looking forward to learning German and Polish next.
- Last year I was working as an English teacher for little children as a part-time job. This experience significantly increased my patience levels.
